<h1>Discord Bot - JarvisAI</h1>

<p>The Discord Bot is a project that started as a personal JarvisAI project based off J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man. The aim was to create a bot that can respond to request, help with information, control home automation, and perform other functions. The Offline version is functional with Text to Speech and voice recognition, the discord version has had the majority of commands removed and now utilises chatGPT. The chatGPT Discord Bot integrates the chatGPT API and the SOLAX solar inverter into one Discord bot. This bot can check the solar output of a system and utilize the chatGPT API to create an intelligent Discord bot.</p>

<p>With chatGPT, there is no longer any need to utilize other modules like wiki and inspirational quotes that existed in early versions. Depending on where the script is running, additional commands can also be introduced to provide additional functionality like home automation and running other custom scripts.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<li>Intelligent responses powered by chatGPT API</li>
<li>Solar output checking using SOLAX solar inverter API</li>
<li>Home automation and custom script execution (depending on where the script is running)</li>
